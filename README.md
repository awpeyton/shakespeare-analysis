## Shakespeare-analysis
*Final project for a data mining course &amp; foray into digital humanities using text mining to analyze Shakespeare's plays.*

This project was completed in Spring 2021 at Syracuse University's iSchool, in IST 707 Data Analytics taught by Yang Yang.

The objective of this project was to explore a field of data mining of interest using skills learned in the class. As a graduate of a liberal arts program, I have wanted to explore the digital humanities, so I chose digital humanities as my topic, focusing on Shakespeare's complete body of work. 

The project brought out some useful insights, though nothing that hasn't been posited about this prolific author's work before. I'm most proud of the data gathering and cleaning that went into this project, as I feel it displays my skills in those areas well. 

Some of the work in this project - specifically the work contained within shake_disputed_works.rmd - echoes previous work posted in my federalist-papers repository. Check that out for some more data wrangling, classification & clustering examples.

If I were to re-do this project, I would likely choose a different subject within the digital humanities to work with. Shakespeare's work has been studied for hundreds of years by thousands of scholars, and a project like this is unlikely to display any new insights into his work. 

To explore this project, begin with shake_data_cleaning.rmd, followed by shake_genre_analysis.rmd and shake_disputed_works.rmd. The final report produced for this work can be found at shake_report.pdf.
